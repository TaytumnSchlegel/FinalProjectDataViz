# FinalProjectDataViz


For your Final Project, you will create a Shiny App dashboard AND a Tableau dashboard.

The shiny app must have everything from this class (plotly, animations, widgets, etc) to display the findings of a machine learning project.

You must build a:

Neural Network
Deep Learning Neural Network
Random Forest
SVM
AutoML model
To classify something and present the resulting data, visualizations, and metrics (accuracy, significant difference tests, etc).

The dashboard should not run the model, just present the results. The tableau dashboard should present the same data.

This project should be individual, no teams. The problem you are solving has to be something personal and meaningful.
